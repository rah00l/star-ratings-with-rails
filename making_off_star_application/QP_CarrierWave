File Uploader , 

Add at Gemfile
gem 'carrierwave'

bundle install

Generators
1. rails g uploader image

2. rails g migration add_image_to_photos image:string

rake db:migrate

Add inside class like
Photo Model

mount_uploader :image, ImageUploader

Add image column to attr_accesiable 

* Add View Section inside Photo

<% f.file_field :image %>

Also create form as a multipart like
:html  => {:multipart => true }


At display portion make following changes,
<%= image_tag photo.image_url.to_s %>

For image processesing like resizing at all ..use rmagick
Uncomment rmagick module 

Also uncomment and modify following code 
version :thumb do
	process :resize_to_limit => [200,200]
end


Need to add gem 'rmagick' inside Gemfile

Also need to install imagemagick also.
Now then 
<%= image_tag photo.image_url(:thumb).to_s %>

If you want to provide image remote like providing url then
<p>
<%= f.label :remote_image_url "or image Url" %><br/>
<%= f.text_field :remote_image_url  %>
</p>

Add at model for attr_accessible like,
remote_image_url
