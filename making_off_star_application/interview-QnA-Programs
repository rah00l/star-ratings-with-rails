Q1 Explain each of the following operators and how and when they should be used: ==, ===, eql?, equal?.
Hide answer

== – Checks if the value of two operands are equal (often overridden to provide a class-specific definition of equality).

=== – Specifically used to test equality within the when clause of a case statement (also often overridden to provide meaningful class-specific semantics in case statements).

eql? – Checks if the value and type of two operands are the same (as opposed to the == operator which compares values but ignores types). For example, 1 == 1.0 evaluates to true, whereas 1.eql?(1.0) evaluates to false.

equal? – Compares the identity of two objects; i.e., returns true iff both operands have the same object id (i.e., if they both refer to the same object). Note that this will return false when comparing two identical copies of the same
