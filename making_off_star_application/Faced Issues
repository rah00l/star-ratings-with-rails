Q - Rails: error while installing rubyracer

A - I figured the easiest thing is to use the last version of the gem. So I updated my Gemfile to point to the last version like so:gem "therubyracer", "~> 0.10.2" and I was able to successfully install the gem. If you want to manually install the gem, you can use: gem install therubyracer --version "~> 0.10.2"
